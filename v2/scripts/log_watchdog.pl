# v2 Log Watchdog  -  Log Monitoring Daemon (The Fucking v2 Rewrite)
#
# This is the v2 rewrite of the v1 log monitor. The v1 version was written
# in Bash. It was 47 lines of pure hell  -  grep pipelines, awk hacks, and a
# `tail -f` that was somehow also a `cron` job. Yes, a `tail -f` running
# as a cron job. Nobody on the team knew how it worked. It just ran. Every
# minute. In production. Since 2019.
#
# The v2 version is written in Perl because Perl is what you use when you
# want to feel something. It's also what you use when you want your code
# to be unreadable by anyone who wasn't there in the 90s. Perl is the
# Latin of programming languages  -  dead but still showing up in places
# where it has no fucking business being.
#
# What this does:
#   1. Watches log files for error patterns using regular expressions
#   2. Aggregates errors by type, count, and service
#   3. Sends alerts to Slack when error rates exceed thresholds
#   4. Rotates log files when they get too big
#   5. Crashes occasionally for no fucking reason
#
# The crash happens when Perl's regex engine hits a pathological pattern
# in a log line. We've seen it 3 times in production. Each time it was
# caused by a developer logging a giant JSON blob without escaping. The
# fix was to add a max line length check. We did that. It still crashes.
# The regex engine doesn't care about your max line length check.
#
# TODO: Move Slack webhook loading to Vault. The production deployment
# still relies on environment or file-based secret injection because the
# Vault read logic was never finished.
#
# Usage:
#   ./log_watchdog.pl --config config.yaml
#   ./log_watchdog.pl --daemon
#   ./log_watchdog.pl --test-alert  # sends a test alert to Slack
#   ./log_watchdog.pl --test-alert --dry-run-alert
#   ./log_watchdog.pl --fucking-help
